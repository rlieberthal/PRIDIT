\title{
A function to generate PRIDIT scores
}
\description{
This function applies principal components analysis (PCA) to ridit scores
as described in Bross, 1958 as revised in Brockett et. al, 2002
in order to generate PRIDIT scores as described in Brockett et. al, 2002. Ridit
scores are generated by the ridit() function included in this package. The result
of this process is a score from -1 to 1 representing both the class identity of the
observation as indicated by the sign and the intensity of the identity as indicated by
the magnitude of the score.
}
\usage{
PRIDITscore(x)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
x is a matrix consisting of a vector of IDs in the first column and ridit
scores for each variable in the other columns. x is generated as a result of the
ridit() function.
}
}
\details{
%%  ~~ If necessary, more details than the description above ~~
}
\value{
The function returns a matrix with two vectors. The first is a vector of
IDs, and the second is a vector of PRIDIT scores.
