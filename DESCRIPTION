Description: This package implements the PRIDIT scoring system of Brockett, et al., 2002.
    It has three separate functions. One implements ridit scoring as originally
    created by Bross, 1958 and modified by Brockett, et al., 2002. A second function creates a 
    set of PRIDIT weights for each variable in a data set. A third function
    applies those PRIDIT weights to the data to determine a PRIDIT score
    from -1 to 1 for each observation.
